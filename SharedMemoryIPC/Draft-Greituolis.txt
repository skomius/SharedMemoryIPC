Use private namespace for and thats all for security
This saves from accident but not from intentional actions

create method and connect method they are static 
and returns shared memory object. It has to overloads create and connect from handle
and with name, option client can supply private space object 

so what to use mutex or event(.NET class) if event mix to interlocked 

write and read byte, string, byte array
write read async method
write and wait for replay method

program is for two processes 
if one to connect to second process need to create second sharedMemory object

create private space class 
open private name space is static method
strong named name space

strong named is just generated long key. It can be used string.

klausimai ispresti: 
craete and connect overloads 
more acurate methods read  write methods
